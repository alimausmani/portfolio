            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Alima Usmani </span>
            from <span className="purple">Uttar Pradesh, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently a student at NavGurukul, where I have developed my skills in
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Bootstrap.
            <br />
            Recently, I completed the MERN stack bootcamp at Zuvy, expanding my expertise
            in full-stack development.
            <br />
            Iâ€™ve also worked with the Milaan Foundation as a Leader, where I had the privilege
            of guiding and empowering over 20 students.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, here are some other activities I love to do!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Playing Games
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Cooking
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Exploring New Technologies
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p style={{ color: "rgb(155 126 172)" }}>
            "Always be curious and strive to make a positive impact!"{" "}
